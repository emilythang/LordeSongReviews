# Lorde Song Reviews

Ella Yelich-O'Connor, better known as Lorde, is a New Zealand singer-songwriter whose iconic music defined the pop industry of the 2010s, allowing millions of people to express themselves through her electrifying music, whether it be dancing in one's bedroom, singing in the shower, or destressing after a long day of work. As an avid Lorde listener, I believe it's time I review some of her most well-known songs and personal favorites of mine (in no particular order)! 

## 1. Royals

Perhaps Lorde's most famous song is the classic "Royals," written by Lorde at the mere age of 16â€”impressive, right? In fact, this song earned Lorde her first career Grammy awards and nominations in 2013, claiming "Song of the Year" and "Best Pop Solo Performance." Not to mention, the unique lyricism and sound is what set her apart from other pop artists at the time; Lorde seems to reject the typical cotton-candy, pop music norms, combining the captivating sound of her raspy, deep-toned voice with the prominent beats, bass, and synths. 

## 2. Ribs

Recently popular among Gen Z teens, the song "Ribs" is the epitome of nostalgia, adolescence, and the fear of growing up. Showing off both her rich, deep voice and high notes later in the song, Lorde's lyrics comment on her bittersweet experiences of going into adulthood and straying further away from the secure bubble of her childhood world. This is the perfect song to blast at 5 AM on a roadtrip, to feel like the "main character" of your life, or to experience pure euphoria as you listen to the sound of soft synths and Lorde's angelic voice.

## 3. Green Light

"Green Light" is a total bop; Lorde carefully masks her dark, painful lyrics with upbeat, joyous tunes one might dance the night away to. Underneath all the fake happiness lies Lorde's intense lyrics about heartbreak and separation. Indeed, Lorde describes this song as "that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess," which perfectly encapsulates the essence of "Green Light." Listening to this song always makes me feel like I'm dancing on a light-up floor underneath flashing colorful lights.

## 4. Liability

"Liability" is essentially the 21st century anthem of sadness; it's the song you might turn on when you feel like a liability. Every word, every piano key played sounds as though it's dripping with tears and drenched in loneliness. Regardless, the lyrics are beautifully written and packed with emotion, just like so many of her other songs. Lorde's ballad "Liability" definitely captures what it feels like to be hollow and blue.

## 5. Hard Feelings/Loveless

"Hard Feelings/Loveless" is a two-in-one song that is the definition of "hauntingly beautiful." Featuring poetic verses and experimental beats followed by a mesmerizing incantation of post-breakup bitterness, this song literally sounds like a heart is being ripped up, tossed, thrown, and shattered into a million pieces. Lorde uses the metaphor of changing seasons throughout the song to juxtapose her feelings of warm bliss with cold sorrow, brilliantly narrating her heartache and numbness from falling out of love. If you ask me, this song is truly a work of art.
