# Lorde Song Reviews

Ella Yelich-O'Connor, better known as Lorde, is a New Zealand singer-songwriter whose iconic music defined the pop industry of the 2010s, allowing millions of people to express themselves through her electrifying music, whether it be dancing in one's bedroom, singing in the shower, or destressing after a long day of work. As an avid Lorde listener, I believe it's time I review some of her most well-known songs and personal favorites of mine (in no particular order)! 

## 1. Royals

Perhaps Lorde's most famous song is the classic "Royals," written by Lorde at the mere age of 16â€”impressive, right? In fact, this song earned Lorde her first career Grammy awards and nominations in 2013, claiming "Song of the Year" and "Best Pop Solo Performance." Not to mention, the unique lyricism and sound is what set her apart from other pop artists at the time; Lorde seems to reject the typical cotton-candy, pop music norms, combining the captivating sound of her raspy, deep-toned voice with the prominent beats, bass, and synths.
